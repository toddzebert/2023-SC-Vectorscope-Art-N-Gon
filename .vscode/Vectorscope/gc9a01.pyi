        If buffer_size is specified it must be large enough to contain the largest bitmap, font character and/or JPG used (Rows * Columns *2 bytes). Specifying a buffer_size reserves memory for use by the driver otherwise memory required is allocated and free dynamicly as it is needed. Dynamic allocation can cause heap fragmentation so garbage collection (GC) should be enabled.
